# H20 R tutorials    

This is a collection of R markdownd files intended to train the reader
on different [H2O](http://0xdata.com/) concepts, from basic to advanced, 
by using the R language.  

## Instructions  

A good way of using these tutorials is by first cloning the repo, and then 
connect to a H2O cluster from RStudio. The first tutorial will cover this
and other H2O basics.  
 
## Datasets  

We will be using datasets from the [KDD Cup 1999](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html).

## Notebooks  

The following notebooks can be examined individually, although there is a more
or less linear 'story' when followed in sequence. By using the same dataset
they try to solve a related set of tasks with it.  
 
### Connecting to H2O and importing data  

About connecting to a H2O cluster, loading data, and refering to it in H2O.  
  
### Data manipulation and description  

### Using `ddply`  

### Liner models  

### Tree-based models  

### Clsutering
